# QML Learning Projects

Welcome to my **QML Learning Projects** repository! This repository showcases the projects Iâ€™ve completed while studying QML through an online course. Each project demonstrates key concepts in QML, from basic UI elements to advanced data handling and animations.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a learning portfolio, documenting my progress and understanding of QML and Qt Quick. Each project folder includes a specific topic or concept covered in my QML course.

## Getting Started

To get started with these projects, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QML-Learning.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory and follow the instructions in each project folder to set up and run the applications.

## Projects Overview

Each folder represents a different QML project or concept from my course:

- **Project 1: Basic UI Elements**  
  Demonstrates the usage of text, buttons, and basic interactive elements in QML.

- **Project 2: Data Binding and Models**  
  Covers data binding concepts and shows how to manage data lists with models.

- **Project 3: Animations and Transitions**  
  Focuses on applying animations and transitions for a dynamic user interface.

- **Project 4: Custom Components and Modular Design**  
  Introduces custom reusable components and the structure of larger applications.

## Technologies Used

- **QML** - for creating user interfaces with a declarative approach
- **Qt Quick** - as the framework for interactive application development
- **Git** - for version control and project tracking

## Running the Projects

1. Ensure you have **Qt and Qt Creator** installed.
2. Open each project file (such as `.pro` or `.qmlproject`) in Qt Creator.
3. Build and run the project within Qt Creator to explore its functionality.

## Learning Goals

Through these projects, I aim to:

- Develop a thorough understanding of **QML syntax and structure**.
- Apply **data binding** techniques and manage **states** and **transitions**.
- Build modular applications using **component-based architecture**.
- Utilize **animations** to create visually engaging user experiences.

## Acknowledgments

These projects were created as part of a QML learning course, which provided valuable insights and foundational knowledge of QML and Qt Quick.
